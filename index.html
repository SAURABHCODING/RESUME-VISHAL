    <h3>Smart Helmet</h3><br/>
    Implemented using Arduino for enhanced motorcycle safety.
    Features: vibration sensors, GPS data extraction, and automatic alerts via GSM module.
    Recognised by professors, submitted for further development to the college innovative cell.<br/>
    <h3>Automatic Street lights</h3><br/>
    LDR sensor is used for detecting the presence of surrounding light so that during the day
    time when sun is bright, the street light is switched off automatically. During the night time
    when there is no light, the LDR sends signal to microcontroller to turn on the street light.
    Features: ldr, switch,pcb,led, battery,connecting wire.
    Future scope: It can be used in garage or  in removing ordinary street lights by these.<br/><br/><hr/>
